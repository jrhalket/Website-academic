 abstract = {Tests of convergence in a time series framework are historically univariate and/or in an I(1)-versus-I(0) context. However, convergence hypotheses can and probably should be generalized to include multivariate, fractionally integrated processes. I propose several potential convergence definitions and use semi-parametric tests for bivariate and multivariate fractional cointegration in the G-7 countries. Results indicate possible convergence as well as highlight why other procedures may fail to find convergence.},
